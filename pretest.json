        "a": "To prove that some languages are not context-free.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! The Pumping Lemma is a tool used to prove that certain languages are not context-free.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Minimization is not the purpose of the Pumping Lemma.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The lemma is not about generating grammars.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! At least one of v or y must be non-empty so that 'pumping' has an effect.",
        "b": "Correct! Another key condition is that the middle portion vxy has length at most p.",

        "a": "Correct! Pumping means repeating (or removing) the parts v and y while keeping the rest unchanged.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Pumping does not add productions.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This refers to grammar transformations, not pumping.",

        "a": "It can only prove that a language is not context-free, not that it is context-free.",

        "a": "Correct! The Pumping Lemma is a negative test — it can prove non-context-freeness but cannot prove context-freeness.",

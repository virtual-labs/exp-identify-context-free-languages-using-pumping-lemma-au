        "a": "To prove that a language is context-free",

        "d": "To remove ambiguity in a grammar"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The Pumping Lemma is not used to prove a language is context-free.",
        "b": "Correct! The Pumping Lemma is mainly used to show that certain languages are not context-free.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Minimization is not its purpose.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Ambiguity removal is unrelated."

      "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'pumping' property in the Pumping Lemma for CFLs?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Any sufficiently long string in the language can be divided into parts that can be repeated while still remaining in the language.",
        "b": "Every string in the language is finite.",
        "c": "The language can be recognized by a deterministic PDA.",
        "d": "The grammar has no useless symbols."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! This is the essence of the Pumping Lemma.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This has nothing to do with pumping.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The lemma is not about PDA determinism.",
        "d": "Incorrect. That is a grammar simplification property."

      "question": "What happens if a language fails to satisfy the Pumping Lemma for context-free languages?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The language is definitely context-free.",
        "b": "The language is definitely not context-free.",
        "c": "The language becomes regular.",
        "d": "The grammar becomes ambiguous."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Failing the lemma means the language cannot be CFL.",
        "b": "Correct! Failure proves non-context-freeness.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Regularity is unrelated here.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Ambiguity is not the issue."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is context-free (recognized by a PDA).",
        "b": "Correct! This classic example cannot be pumped properly, proving it is not CFL.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is a CFL since it allows any counts of a’s followed by b’s.",

      "question": "What are the five parts (u, v, x, y, z) in the Pumping Lemma for CFLs used for?",

        "a": "To divide the string into sections where v and y can be 'pumped' (repeated or removed).",
        "b": "To identify the productions of the grammar.",
        "c": "To simplify the PDA states.",
        "d": "To eliminate useless variables."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Strings are divided into uvxyz, where v and y can be pumped.",
        "b": "Incorrect. They don’t represent productions.",

      "question": "Why is the Pumping Lemma not a sufficient condition for context-freeness?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because some non-CFLs may accidentally satisfy the lemma.",
        "b": "Because it only applies to deterministic grammars.",
        "c": "Because it applies only to ambiguous grammars.",
        "d": "Because it works only for finite languages."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Passing the lemma does not guarantee CFL status, it only proves non-CFL when it fails.",
        "b": "Incorrect. It applies to all CFLs, not just deterministic ones.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Ambiguity is irrelevant here.",
        "d": "Incorrect. It also applies to infinite languages."

        "question": "What role does the Pumping Lemma play in proving the non-context-freeness of a language?",
        "answers": {
          "a": "It provides a set of pumpable strings for the language.",
          "b": "It demonstrates that any string in the language can be 'pumped' to generate more strings.",
          "c": "It guarantees that the language has a finite number of productions.",
          "d": "It only applies to regular languages, not context-free languages."

          "a": "Incorrect. Try again.",
          "b": "Correct! The Pumping Lemma helps show that certain strings in the language can be 'pumped' to generate additional strings, leading to a contradiction.",

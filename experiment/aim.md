<h3>Aim of the Experiment</h3>
<p>
    The aim of this experiment is to determine whether a given language is context-free using the Pumping Lemma. 
    The Pumping Lemma provides a necessary condition that all context-free languages must satisfy. 
    By applying this theorem, we can prove that certain languages are not context-free.

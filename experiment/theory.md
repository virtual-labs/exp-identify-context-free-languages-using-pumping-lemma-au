<u><h3>Theory</h3></u>

<h5>1.Context free grammar</h5>
<p>CFG stands for context-free grammar. It is is a formal grammar which is used to generate all possible patterns of strings in a given formal language. Context-free grammar G can be defined by four tuples as:

V - It is the collection of variables or nonterminal symbols.
T - It is a set of terminals. 
P - It is the production rules that consist of both terminals and nonterminals.
S - It is the Starting symbol.

<h5>Pumping lemma for context free Language</h5>
<p>Pumping lemma for context free language (CFL) is used to prove that a language is not a Context free language</p>
<p>Theorem </p>
<p>If A is a context free language ,then ,A has a pumping length “p” such that any string “S’, where |S|>= p may be divided into 5 pieces S=uvxyz such that the following conditions must be true : </p>

1. Uv<sup>i</sup>xy<sup>i</sup>z is in the A for every i≥0

2. |vy|>0
3. |vxy|≤p

<h5>Steps to apply pumping lemma</h5>
<li>Assume that L is context-free.</li>
<li>The pumping length will be p.</li>
<li>All strings longer than the length(p) can be pumped  |S|≥ p.</li>
<li>Now we have to find a string 'S' in L such that |S|≥ p.</li>
<li>We will divide string 'S' into uvxyz.</li>
<li>Now show that uv<sup>i</sup>xy<sup>i</sup>z ∉L for some constant i.</li>
<li>Then, we have to consider the ways that S can be divided into uvxyz.</li>
<li>Show that none of these can satisfy all the 3 pumping conditions simultaneously.</li>
<li>A string 'S' cannot be pumped (contradiction).</li>
<br>
 <p>Detailed description of the steps mentioned above:</p>

 <p> 1. Assume the language L is context-free: This is our starting point for the proof.</p>
 <p> 2. Identify the pumping length (p): The lemma guarantees the existence of a pumping length p for any context-free language. This p applies to all strings in the language with a length greater than or equal to p (L ≥ p).</p>
 <p>3 .Choose a string S ∈ L and |S| ≥ p: Select a string S from the language L that has a length greater than or equal to the pumping length (n).</p>
 <p>4.  Divide S into five substrings as follows:

<li>u: The prefix before the "pumping section" (can be empty).</li>
<li>v: The substring to be "pumped" (must have at least one symbol).</li>
<li>x: A separator between v and y (can be empty).</li>
<li>y: A copy of v (can be empty).</li>
<li>z: The suffix after the "pumping section" (can be empty).</li>
Therefore, the string w can be represented as S = uvxyz.</p>
<p>5. Apply pumping for different values of i: The lemma states that we can "pump" the substring v by inserting copies of it i times (where i is a non-negative integer) and obtain a new string.</p>
<p>6. Analyze the resulting strings: The key step is to analyze the resulting strings (uwxz, S, and uv<sup>i</sup>xy<sup>i</sup>z) and show that at least one of them does not belong to the language L. This contradicts the initial assumption that L is context-free.</p>
<li>If uwxz is not in L, the language is not context-free because it cannot generate this string even though it's derived from a valid string in L.</li>
<li>If uv<sup>i</sup>xy<sup>i</sup>z is not in L for any i ≥ 2, the language is not context-free because it cannot generate strings with more than one copy of the "pumping section" v, even though longer strings exist in the language.</li>
